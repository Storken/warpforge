	This template is for the index page made at the root of the catalog html view.
	It just lists and links to all the modules in the catalog.

	A couple of todos for this document:
		- We should print CIDs of the modules!
			... But we don't right now because the our accessor functions don't make it easy to get.  (Work needed on workspace.Catalog.)
		- Farther future: we should have a CID of the entire catalog tree root snapshot somewhere, too.
			... But we don't right now, because that should probably use prolly trees (or some other scalable hash tree thing), which is not available and rigged up as a convenient library yet.
